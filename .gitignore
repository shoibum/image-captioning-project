Excellent. Getting the project ready for submission on GitHub is the perfect next step. This is a crucial skill for any engineer. I'll guide you through the entire process and provide a professional-grade README.md file.

Here are the step-by-step instructions.

First, I'll provide a comprehensive README.md file. This is the "front page" of your project on GitHub and is essential for explaining what your project does and how to use it.

Create a new file named README.md in the root of your image-captioning-project folder and paste the following content into it.

Second, a .gitignore file is crucial. It tells Git which files and folders to ignore (like the virtual environment and cache files). Create a new file named .gitignore in your project's root directory and paste this in:

# Python
__pycache__/
*.py[cod]
*$py.class

# Virtual Environment
venv/

# IDE / Editor specific
.vscode/
.idea/

# Data and Models
data/
# models/ (optional)
*.pth.tar

# macOS
.DS_Store
